v0.1.1, January 2020 -- Quality of life update
MATLAB:
- New functionality:
    - split_surfaces.m 
    - fusion.m
    - surface_to_graph.m
- Bug fixes:
    - Fixed a bug where the example data loaders failed when the BrainSpace
      directory was not named "BrainSpace".
    - Matrix sparsification now correctly thresholds -inf. 
    - The "Running with sparsity parameter..." message will now correctly 
      display with every kernel. 
    - Fixed a bug where joint embedding of non-square matrices would fail.
    - plot_hemispheres will no longer error when using non-float data. 
- Other changes:
    - Optimized the spin_permutation code. It should now run substantially 
      faster, especially with a large number of permutations.
    - Improved several warning/error messages.
    - All MATLAB ReadTheDocs hyperlinks now refer to the stable version of 
      ReadTheDocs, rather than the latest. 

Python:


ReadTheDocs:
- Added matrix fusion example to MATLAB tutorial 2.
