Welcome to BrainSpace's documentation!
======================================

BrainSpace is a lightweight cross-platform toolbox primarily intended for
macroscale gradient mapping and analysis. The current version of BrainSpace is
available in Python and Matlab, programming languages widely used by the
neuroimaging and network neuroscience communities. The toolbox also contains
several maps that allow for exploratory analysis of gradient correspondence
with several features, together with tools to generate spatial null models.
