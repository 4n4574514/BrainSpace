Matlab Package
======================================

This page contains links to descriptions of all Matlab code available in this toolbox as well as a few example applications. The code is divided into three groups: "main functionality" which performs the computations, "visualization" which plots data, and "support functions" which supports the other functions, but are not intended for usage by the user.
