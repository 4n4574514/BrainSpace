Matlab Package
======================================

This page contains links to descriptions of all Matlab code available in this
toolbox as well as a few example applications. The code is divided into three
groups: "main functionality" which performs the computations, "visualization"
which plots data, and "support functions" which supports the other functions,
but are not intended for usage by the user.
