MATLAB Package
======================================

<<<<<<< HEAD
This page contains links to descriptions of all Matlab code available in this toolbox 
as well as a few example applications. The code is divided into three groups: 
"main functionality" which performs the computations, "visualization" which plots data, 
and "support functions" which supports the other functions, but are not 
intended for usage by the user.

This page contains links to descriptions of all MATLAB code available in this
toolbox as well as the tutorials. The code is divided into four groups: "main
functionality" which performs the computations, "visualization" which plots
data, "data loaders" which loads some sample data, and "support functions" which
supports the other functions, but are not intended for usage by the user.
